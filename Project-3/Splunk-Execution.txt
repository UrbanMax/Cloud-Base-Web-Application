Load and Analyze Windows Logs:

Navigate to Splunk and select "Add Data" > "Upload."
Choose the provided windows_server_logs.csv file.
Set the source type as instructed and name the host "Windows_server_logs."
Review settings and upload the data into Splunk.
Ensure data is searchable by selecting "Start Searching."
Create Reports, Alerts, and Dashboards for Windows Logs

Reports:
Report with a table of signatures and associated signature IDs.
Report displaying severity levels and their counts.
Report comparing success vs. failure of Windows activities.

Alerts:
Set alerts for suspicious levels of failed activities, successful logins, and deleted accounts.

Visualizations and Dashboards:
Design visualizations (e.g., line charts, geographical maps, pie charts) based on signatures, users, HTTP methods, etc., and compile them into a dashboard named "Windows Server Monitoring."

Load and Analyze Apache Logs:
Use Splunk's "Add Data" > "Upload" feature to upload apache_logs.txt.
Set source type to "Apache_logs" and upload the data.
Verify data upload and search for Apache logs.
Create Reports, Alerts, and Dashboards for Apache Logs

Reports:
Report on HTTP methods, top referrer domains, and HTTP response codes.

Alerts:
Set alerts for international activity and suspicious HTTP POST activity.

Visualizations and Dashboards:
Design visualizations (e.g., line charts, geographical maps, statistical charts) based on HTTP methods, referrer domains, user agents, etc., and compile them into a dashboard named "Apache Web Server Monitoring."

Install an Add-On Splunk Application for Additional Monitoring:
Choose and install a relevant Splunk add-on app from Splunkbase.
Ensure the app enhances VSI's monitoring capabilities and describe a scenario demonstrating its utility.
Capture screenshots of the installed add-on app.

 

Load and Analyze Windows Logs:

Open Splunk and navigate to "Add Data."
Select "Upload" and choose windows_server_logs.csv.
Set source type to default and proceed.
Name the host as "Windows_server_logs" and review settings.
Confirm successful upload and start searching with the data.
Analyze important fields like signature_id, signature, user, status, and severity.
Create Reports, Alerts, and Dashboards for Windows Logs

Reports:
Generate reports for signatures, severity levels, and activity comparison (success vs. failure).

Alerts:
Set up alerts based on thresholds for failed activities, successful logins, and account deletions.

Visualizations and Dashboards:
Design visualizations using different chart types (line charts, pie charts) for signatures, users, and Windows activity.
Organize these into a dashboard named "Windows Server Monitoring" with time range flexibility.

Load and Analyze Apache Logs:
Repeat the data upload process for Apache logs (apache_logs.txt).
Set source type to default and proceed with the upload.
Confirm successful upload and begin searching with the new data.
Analyze key fields like method, referer_domain, status, clientip, and useragent.
Create Reports, Alerts, and Dashboards for Apache Logs

Reports:
Generate reports for HTTP methods, referrer domains, and HTTP response codes.

Alerts:
Set alerts for international activity and suspicious HTTP POST activity based on defined thresholds.

Visualizations and Dashboards:
Design visualizations like line charts for HTTP methods, geographical maps for client IPs, and pie charts for user agents.
Consolidate these into a dashboard named "Apache Web Server Monitoring" with customizable time ranges.
Install an Add-On Splunk Application for Additional Monitoring:
Choose and install a relevant add-on app from Splunkbase.
Demonstrate the app's utility in enhancing VSI's monitoring capabilities.
Capture screenshots of the installed add-on app and describe a scenario illustrating its use.
By completing these steps, you'll have established a comprehensive monitoring solution using Splunk to safeguard VSI's systems against potential cyberattacks and suspicious activities.
