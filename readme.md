## Project 1 - Cloud Based Apache Web Server

The goal of this project is to develop and style web pages using CSS to achieve visually appealing and well-structured layouts.
Furthermore, I aimed to prepare the website for deployment on the internet by setting up a domain and obtaining an SSL certificate to ensure secure access for users.

Tools Used:

Visual Studio Code: Utilized as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for coding and styling web pages with CSS.
Azure Lab Environment: Provided a virtualized environment for web development tasks, offering scalability and convenience for project work.
Domain Registration Service: Used to register and acquire a domain name (e.g., example.com) for the website.
SSL Certificate Provider: Obtained an SSL certificate to encrypt data transmitted between users and the website, ensuring secure communication.

## Project 2 -  -  Rekall Penetration Test

The goal of the penetration testing project is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities present in web applications,
Linux servers, and Windows servers to assess their security posture and recommend improvements.

Tools Used:

Metasploit: A penetration testing framework that provides tools for exploiting security vulnerabilities.
Nmap (Zenmap): Network mapping tool used for discovering hosts and services on a computer network.
Google Hacking: Using advanced search techniques to find vulnerable targets or sensitive information on the internet.
John the Ripper: A password cracking tool used to perform brute-force attacks on password hashes.
Privilege Escalation CVE: Leveraging known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) to escalate 
privileges on compromised systems.
Bash Scripting: Creating custom scripts in Bash to automate tasks and exploit vulnerabilities identified during testing.

## Project 3 -  -  Splunk - Building a Security Monitoring Environment

The goal of establishing a Security Monitoring Environment is to implement robust monitoring and defense mechanisms to safeguard Virtual Space Industries (VSI) against potential cyberattacks,
particularly from competitors such as JobeCorp.

Tool Used:

Splunk (SIEM Platform): Employed Splunk as the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform to centrally collect, analyze, and respond to security events and threats within the VSI environment. This tool enhances visibility and enables proactive threat detection and incident response capabilities to mitigate cyber risks effectively.
